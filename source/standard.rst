*Carob* uses the *terminag* standard** that defines a controlled vocabulary of variable names, their units, and acceptable (ranges of) values. 

The *terminag* standard can be used "stand-alone" for your own data, and as part of the data compilation done through the Carob project.

The standard is defined in a number of tables that are available on the `termiag <https://github.com/reagro/terminag>`__ github site and via the R package `carobiner <https://github.com/reagro/carobiner>`__.
