The standard
============

The *Carob* standard defines a controlled vocabulary of variable names, their units, and acceptable (ranges of) values. 

The standard can be used "stand-alone" for your own data, and as part of the data compilation done through the Carob project.

The standard is defined in a number of tables that are available on the github site and via the R package carobiner. The standard is not an ontology in the sense that, with very few exceptions, we do not semantically relate variables to each other.
