*Carob* produces large standardized data sets to facilitate agricultural research. It is an open-source, collaborative and community based *Extract, Transform, and Load* `(ETL) project supported by CGIAR <https://www.cgiar.org/initiative/excellence-in-agronomy/>`_. All data transformations are done with *R* scripts, making it easy to enhance the standardization process as needs arise, and to correct mistakes. Please consider `contributing <contribute.html>`_!
