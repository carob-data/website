CAROB data
==========

The aim of the *Carob project* is to compile agricultural research data from experiments and surveys into a standard format, and to aggregate individual data sets into larger data bases that can be used in further research. 

This is an open-source, collaborative, community project to which you can `contribute <contribute.html>`_!

You can `download <data.html>`_ the compiled data from this site, or re-generate them yourself using the CAROB `scripts <https://github.com/reagro/carob>`_.
