Carob
=====


*Carob* is the open-source, collaborative and community based *Extract, Transform, and Load* `(ETL) framework supported by CGIAR <https://www.cgiar.org/initiative/excellence-in-agronomy/>`_ to support agricultural research. All data transformations are done with *R* scripts, making it easy to enhance the standardization process as needs arise, and to correct mistakes. Please consider `contributing <contribute.html>`_!
