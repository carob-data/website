Carob
=====

The aim of the *Carob* project is to compile agricultural research data from experiments and surveys into a standard format, and to aggregate individual data sets into larger data bases that can be used in further research. The data is described `here <data.html>`_.

This is an open-source, collaborative, community project to which you can `contribute <contribute.html>`_!

You can `download <download.html>`_ the compiled data from this site, or re-generate them yourself using the *Carob* `scripts <https://github.com/reagro/carob>`_.
