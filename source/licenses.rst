Licenses
========

Individual datasets come with their own licenses. Almost all data providers use a `creative commons license <https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/>`__  such as `CC BY 4.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>`__.  

The main exception to this rule is data from `CIMMYT <https://www.cimmyt.org/>`__. CIMMYT is perhaps the largest provider of open agricultural research data, but their data come with a bespoke "CIMMYT license" described `here <https://orderseed.cimmyt.org/AGREEMENT_FOR_ACCESS_%20AND_USE_DATA.pdf>`__. For the official license(s) see the `CIMMYT dataverse <https://data.cimmyt.org/>`__.

You can check the license for specific datasets in the on-line "reports", and in the "metadata" files. Please do not use data that has a license that prohibits your use.
