Contribute
==========

*Carob* is compiled by writing an R script for each individual dataset of interest. They are all available on the `github <https://github.com/reagro/carob/>`_ site.

Anyone is invited to contribute new scripts or improve existing ones. See these preliminary
`guidelines <https://github.com/reagro/carob/wiki/Guidelines>`_.

A great place to discover new data sets is the `Gardian <https://gardian.bigdata.cgiar.org>`_ website.
Also see our `to-do list <todo.html>`_ for ideas (and check our `done list <done.html>`_ to make sure you do not replicate what has already been done.

The best way to contribute is to

1. **fork** the *Carob* `repo <https://github.com/reagro/carob/>`_ to your github account. 
2. **clone** the forked repo to your computer
3. Add a new script, or make the changes to an existing script.
3. **push** these changes to the forked repo on your github account.
4. **sync** the forked repo with main repo in reagro/carob such that your fork is not behind.
5. create a **pull request** to integrate your changes into the main repo.

Try to keep pull requests simple. Ideally, they should consist of only one file at at time.

If this procedure is too complicated we can also interact with you in other ways. You can always drop us an email at  carob.data@gmail.com.
