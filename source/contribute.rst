Contribute
==========

*Carob* is compiled by writing an R script for each individual dataset of interest. They are all available on the `github <https://github.com/reagro/carob/>`_ site.

Anyone is invited to contribute new scripts or improve existing ones. See these preliminary
`guidelines <https://github.com/reagro/carob/wiki/Guidelines>`_.

A great place to discover new data sets is the `Gardian <https://gardian.bigdata.cgiar.org>`_ website.

The best way to contribute is to **fork** the *Carob* **repo** to your github account, **clone** it to your local computer, make the changes you want to make, **push** these changes to your fork, and then, on github, create a **pull request** to integrate your changes into the main project.

If that is too complicated we can also interact with you in other ways. You can always drop us an email.
